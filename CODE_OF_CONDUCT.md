# Code of Conduct

## The Golden Rule

Be cool. We're all just trying to organize our chaotic bookmark collections here.

## The Slightly Longer Version

### We Welcome Everyone

ADHX is for anyone who:
- Has 847 unread bookmarks (and counting)
- Saves tweets "to read later" (we both know you won't)
- Gets distracted mid-sentence and forgets what they were—oh look, a squirrel!

Seriously though, we welcome contributors regardless of experience level, background, identity, or how many browser tabs you currently have open (no judgment on that 200+ count).

### Expected Behavior

- **Be kind** – We're all learning, and someone's "obvious" question might be their breakthrough moment
- **Be patient** – Not everyone replies instantly (they might be down a Wikipedia rabbit hole)
- **Be constructive** – "This could be better because..." beats "This is bad"
- **Give credit** – If someone's idea helped you, say so!
- **Stay on topic** – Save the hot takes for Twitter (and then bookmark them here, obviously)

### Not Cool

- Harassment, discrimination, or being a jerk
- Trolling or deliberately derailing conversations
- Sharing others' private info
- Any behavior that makes others feel unwelcome

### Enforcement

If someone's being uncool:
1. They'll get a friendly heads-up
2. Continued issues = temporary timeout
3. Serious violations = permanent ban

We'd rather not do any of that, so let's all just be decent humans.

## Reporting Issues

See something? Say something. Reach out to the maintainers privately.

We take reports seriously and will handle them with discretion.

## TL;DR

Don't be a jerk. Help each other out. Save more bookmarks than you'll ever read.
